# TrainReservationPortal
The Railway Reservation Portal is a fully functional Java application build with a GUI that simulates an online railway reservation system.
This is a simple online train reservation system created by me.
This system allows users to register and login to their accounts, select their origin and destination stations, choose their class, and book their train tickets.
The application calculates the total ticket price and prompts the user to enter their payment information. After the payment is complete. The system generates an E-ticket with booking details and payment confirmation slip. 
This covers all 9 railway lines and 401 railway stations within the Sri Lanka. And available with 7 main ticket price variations under both adults and child category. This database consists of 40+ trains and their details.
And you can use this as your project template.
