# TrainReservationPortal
The Railway Reservation Portal is a fully functional Java application built with a GUI that simulates an online railway reservation system.
This is a simple online train reservation system created by me.
This system allows users to register and log in to their accounts, select their origin and destination stations, choose their classes, and book their train tickets.
The application calculates the ticket price and prompts users to enter payment information. After the payment is complete. The system generates an E-ticket with booking details and a payment confirmation slip.
